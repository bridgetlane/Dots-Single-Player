<h2>Dots (Single Player Version)</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>POLISHED CHANGES:</strong>
This version of Dots is single player. The player plays against the computer. Improvements/polish include the AI computer player, restart/info buttons, score calculation, and ability to choose your colors.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
This version of Dots is single player. Connect the dots while keeping your opponents from doing so.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The player experience should be fun and interactive. This time, I made the game single player, adding another way to play.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Casual games.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
Pick your colors. The object of the game is to have the most completed rows/cols of your color at the end of the game.
<br>Select or deselect any circle on the board for your turn. You CANNOT pass your turn.
<br> If all 4 circles in a row or column are selected, the whole row/column will become locked (selected permanently). 
<br>The COLOR of the last circle selected in a row/column will decide who that row/column goes to. When the last circle is selected, the entire row/col will become the color of that circle. This row/col is now UNMOVEABLE.
<br>At the end of the game, the player with the most completed rows/cols of their color wins.
<br><br>NOTE: Order matters. If you win a column, and a row is won, your column will be BROKEN by the row!
<br>System dynamics: The circles are unchangeable upon full row/column selection.
<br>Core mechanic: You can  select and deselect circles.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
This prototype explores strategy mixed with some unpredictability. This prototype also explores making a digital game that is multi-player focused, minimizing technology and maximizing player-to-player interaction. 
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Features:</strong>
My game is unique because a row or column you win can easily be lost.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
None.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Story:</strong>
None.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Casual gamers.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
3 minutes.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Keep an eye on your main colors and which of them are selected.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Assets made by me.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I did not model this game or take the game framework from any existing game or Phaser example.
