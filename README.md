# [Dots (Single Player)](http://bridgetlane.github.io/Dots-Single-Player/)
Game for CS 325 using Phaser. Polished version of my earlier game "Dots"
This version of Dots is single player. The player plays against the computer. Improvements/polish include the AI computer player, restart/info buttons, score calculation, and ability to choose your colors.
All of the code for this game resides on the gh-pages branch. Go to http://bridgetlane.github.io/Dots-Single-Player/ to play.
